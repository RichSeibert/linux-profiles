Profile and config files for linux and other things

## Auto setup
Running ./setup.sh will copy all the config files to your home directory keeping the 
file paths. For example, configs/vim/.vim/colors/mononkai.vim will be copied to ~/.vim/colors/monokai.vim.
If you want to add more config files, they must be added to a directory within configs.
