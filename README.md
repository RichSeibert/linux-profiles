# linux-profiles
Profile and configuration files for linux and other things.

## Auto setup
Running ./setup.sh will copy all the config files in "configs" to your home directory keeping the file paths from configs/\*/. 

For example, configs/vim/.vim/colors/monokai.vim will be copied to ~/.vim/colors/monokai.vim.

If you want to add more config files, they must be added to a directory in configs.
